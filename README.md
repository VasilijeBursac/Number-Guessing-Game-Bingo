# Number Guessing Game-Bingo
A game where player guess a number between 1 and 10. The goal is to guess the computer generated number in as few attempts as possible. The game doesn't make much sense and it isn't particularly interesting, but it's a fun thing to try. I made it just for fun few years ago.
